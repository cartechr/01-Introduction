   I am trying to display my answers to the current questions that I was given. For anyone who discovers this discovery, if you discover the video link when running my code, you need to control + click to open it. When someone runs my code, they should expect to see my answers to the questions that I was given along with the link I have "attached" at the bottom of the coding.
